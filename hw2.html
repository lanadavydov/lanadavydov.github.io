                <br><p style="color: rgb(184, 60, 11); text-align: right;"> My response to Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think":</p>
                <br><p style="color: rgb(156, 33, 106); text-align: left;">
                <br> Vannever Bush’s vision for the Memex is what the classic computer is for the average user today. What were once appliances on a desk are now applications on a phone or laptop. Before the commercialization of computers, there would lie a calculator, hundreds of paper files, a file cabinet, framed pictures of loved ones, a trash bin, a notepad, and much of the same on a worker’s desk. Thousands of cubicles in America looked like this. 
                <br>
                <br> On the home screen or desktop of a computer today, all of these physical appliances can be found as digital softwares. The computer was originally meant to replace all of these items, and the execution of this mission was very successful. The average desktop now has much more than these standard applications. 
                <br>
                <br> The Memex paved the way for the development of a number of different software and services our devices have today. In the present day, our devices bear a number of various personal information management systems and computer databases. But what is even more remarkable is that our computers and phones have access to web browsers and the internet. The fact that we can use our technology for our professional and leisure ambitions, is the very thing that Bush describes the Memex would have wanted, as well.
                <br>
                <br> At the end of the piece, Bush goes on to explore the Memex’s potential to influence, if not improve, collaboration and communication between individuals and institutions. I believe this has been achieved in a significant measure by pieces of technology today. And with more advancements underway, I’m sure methods of collaboration and communication will only continue to progress.
