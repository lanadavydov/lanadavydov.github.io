                <br><p style="color: rgb(24, 24, 94);"> My response to "Aureia Harvey and the Future of Digital Sculpture":</p>
                <br><p style="color: rgb(156, 33, 106)">
                <br> The entirety of this piece focused on Auriea Harvey's artistic journey before and through society’s digital advancements. What I found most interesting about the interview were the comparisons Harvey made between physical and digital art. 
                <br>
                <br> “Digital sculptures live in the now, in a future that never ages. The physical object is the archive. That object was digital, but now it is real, pinned to a certain moment, and it can travel through different times and contexts as long as it exists.”
                <br>
                <br> Is this to say that physical objects of art are no longer deemed modern? Are physical objects of art capable of withstanding time, remaining timeless?
                <br>
                <br> I don’t think I have a correct answer to these questions, nor does anyone else. I find that these questions hold underlying biases about how we perceive the world around us. Personally, I feel that a digital art form is the only type of art that can and will forever retain its ‘shape’, for it won’t fall victim to the aging of time. Alas, this can only be true for the time being – until technology will advance to something beyond what it is today. Perhaps, someday in the future, a digital object will be the archive.
