        <h1 style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; padding: 30px;">what about memory?</h1>
        <h1 style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; padding: 30px;">
            how do we remember and commemorate the victims of war?

            it is suggested that there is tension between wanting to remember the victims of war and the difficulty of doing so in a way that is meaningful, valuable, and respectful.
