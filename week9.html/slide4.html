        <h1>What is it?</h1>
        <p>"The Revolving Internet" is a digital artwork created by Constant Dullaart. The artwork is a website that features a continuously rotating interface that displays a Google search engine. </p>
        <h1 style= "margin-bottom: 80px; height: 5px; text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size:15px"> Find it here:<a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet"> https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet</a></h1>
        
        
        <h1>People also ask</h1>
        
        <h1 style="font-style:italic; color: rgb(42, 41, 41); font-size: 20px;">What is its purpose?</h1>
        <p style= "margin-bottom: 30px;">The purpose of "The Revolving Internet" is to highlight the continuous and dynamic nature of the internet and to provide a unique perspective on the way we interact with online platforms. Through his work, Dullaart challenges the traditional static representation of the internet and encourages viewers to question the relationship between online content and the way it is presented. </p>
    
        <h1 style="font-style:italic; color: rgb(42, 41, 41); font-size: 20px;">What does the constant rotating of the search enginge allude to?</h1>
        <p style= "margin-bottom: 30px;">The constant spinning of the search engine is reminiscent of a cinematic 360-degree shot, often meant to provide viewers with a thought-provoking perspective of the world or to highlight a dramatic point. The use of 360-degree spinning shots in cinema is a way for filmmakers to make the viewers look at the many different angles of the world; similarly to how Dullart would like for his audience to look at the online world.

        <h1 style="font-style:italic; color: rgb(42, 41, 41); font-size: 20px;">What is the song, "Windmills of Your Mind" about?</h1>
        <p style= "margin-bottom: 30px;">The general theme of the song revolves around the complexity and fleeting nature of human thought and memory.</p>

        <h1 style="font-style:italic; color: rgb(42, 41, 41); font-size: 20px;">What are some other symbols behind Dullaart's artwork?</h1>
