        <p class="s5body">Another point Dullart was trying to make was how google or more broadly search engines and centralized websites have become so large, becoming this all knowing, essenstial part of using the internet.
            He dislikes the centralization and capital greed of the Web2 internet era and its interesting to see what his take might be on the transition to web3, which works to decentralize the internet.

    <p class="s5bo">“All these works display a simple, single behavior,” wrote Domenico Quaranta of this series. “They all deal with the home page of Google, which remains fully functional despite its unorthodox appearance. Whether you first read the domain name, or first focused on the content of the page, when you put them together you get the joke, and you probably smile. And then? Then you leave, maybe a bit disappointed (especially if you where told that this is a work of art), but also richer in a way. You now know, consciously or unconsciously, that Google is not God. That Google is not the absolute, untouchable, clear thing it pretends to be. It censors, and can be censored. It can be displayed upside down. It can disagree, doubt and sleep. The Revolving Internet is like Andersen’s famous tale, “The Emperor’s New Clothes”: when you read it, nothing really changes, except your perception of those in power. Maybe your king is naked, too.”</p>
